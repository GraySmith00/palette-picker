A simple, yet intuitive application that lets you easily find great color patterns and save them for later use. If you like some colors on the current palette, but not others, you can quickly lock those colors in and randomize the ones you don't like.

This application was made using Node, Express, Knex, and Postgres on the backend and vanilla JavaScript and BlingJS (an extremely light version of jQuery) on the frontend.
